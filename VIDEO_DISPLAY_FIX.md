# Video Display Fix - PropertyDetail.jsx

## Problem
Videos were not showing up on the PropertyDetail page even though:
- Video upload functionality was working
- Frontend code had video support implemented
- Videos were being uploaded successfully to Cloudinary

## Root Cause
The `property_videos` field was **missing from the Property model schema** in the backend. The database schema only included `property_images` but not `property_videos`, so:

1. Videos uploaded were not being saved to the database
2. When fetching property data, `property_videos` was always undefined/empty
3. Frontend couldn't display videos that didn't exist in the database

## Solution

### 1. Added `property_videos` field to Property Model

**File**: `models/property.js`

```javascript
// Added this field to the property schema
property_videos: [
  {
    url: String,
    public_id: String,
    asset_id: String,
  },
],
```

### 2. Updated Property Controller

**File**: `controllers/propertyController.js`

Added handling for `property_videos` in the `updateProperty` function, similar to how `property_images` is handled:

```javascript
// Fix property_videos structure if needed
if (req.body.property_videos && Array.isArray(req.body.property_videos)) {
  req.body.property_videos = req.body.property_videos.map((vid) => {
    // Check if url is an object instead of a string
    if (vid.url && typeof vid.url === "object" && vid.url.url) {
      return {
        url: vid.url.url,
        public_id: vid.url.public_id || vid.public_id || "",
        asset_id: vid.url.asset_id || vid.asset_id || "",
        _id: vid._id, // Keep the _id if it exists
      };
    }
    return vid;
  });
}
```

### 3. Frontend Already Had Video Support

The PropertyDetail.jsx file already had comprehensive video support:
- Video gallery integration
- Mobile and desktop responsive design
- Fullscreen video modal
- Video controls and error handling

## Files Modified

1. **`models/property.js`** - Added `property_videos` field to schema
2. **`controllers/propertyController.js`** - Added video handling in updateProperty function
3. **`src/pages/PropertyDetail.jsx`** - Removed debug logs (video support was already implemented)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Video Upload**: Videos uploaded through the admin/owner interface will now be saved to the database
2. **Video Display**: Videos will appear in the property gallery alongside images
3. **Video Interaction**: Users can:
   - See video thumbnails with "VIDEO" badges
   - Hover to play videos (desktop)
   - Touch to play videos (mobile)
   - Click to view in fullscreen with full controls

## Testing

1. Upload videos to a property through the admin interface
2. Visit the property detail page
3. Videos should now appear in the gallery
4. Test video playback on both desktop and mobile

## Data Format

The system now properly supports this property data format:

```json
{
  "property_images": [
    {
      "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
      "public_id": "aplet360/...",
      "asset_id": "..."
    }
  ],
  "property_videos": [
    {
      "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/duvwweuhj/video/upload/...",
      "public_id": "aplet360/videos/...",
      "asset_id": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Note

This fix resolves the database schema issue. The video upload backend fixes and frontend video display were already working correctly - the missing piece was the database field definition.
